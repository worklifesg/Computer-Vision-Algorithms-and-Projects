### Computer Vision Algorithms and Projects

***This repository deals with algorithms, techniques and projects that are learnt and implemented using PyImageSearch Blog.***

***However the codes are modified for different applications and also the image processing steps used are different from original blog***

***The computer vision applications illustrated are towards medical applications such as chest x-ray, brain tumor, skin cancer, pneumonia, malaria diseases, Parkinson's***
