**Introduction**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Siamese networks are inspired from the term **"siamese twins"** which means **"conjoined twins"** that are connected to each other (difficult to separate)

In neural networks, **"siamese networks"** are special class that contains two or more identical subnetworks (same architecture, parameters, and weights). Any changes in one network will update other network parameters as well. This feature of siamese networks can be widely used in applications such as **face recognition, signature verification** as well as can be extended to **medical imaging** (evaluating the severity of the disease ![Reading paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-0255-1)).

Example |
|----------|
| **Detecting signature forgeries** - In general, we classify model to correctly classify signature based on their training using image classification networks. Here in **siamese networks**, we will use two images as an input from training dataset and ask the neural network if the signature were from the same person or not? |
