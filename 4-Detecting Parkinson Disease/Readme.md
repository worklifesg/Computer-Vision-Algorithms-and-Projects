<h2 align='center'>Project Name : Detecting Parkinson’s Disease with OpenCV, Computer Vision, and the Spiral/Wave Test </h2>


**Introduction**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Parkinson's Disease is a nervous system disorder that effects movement. There is no cure for Parkinson but with proper medication and environment can improve symptoms and quality of life. Such type of disease is progressive in nature and has 5 different stages.


  Stages of Parkinson's Disease|
  |----------|
  |**Stage I:** Mild symptoms - bit of tremors and movement issues on only side of the body. |
  |**Stage II:** Symptoms grow more with small tremors and mmovements on both sides of the body. |
  |**Stage III:** Loss of balance and movements with falls more frequent and common. Can still live independently. |
  |**Stage IV:** Severe and constraining symptoms. Unable to live alone and needs assistance for daily activities |
  |**Stage V:** Likely possible to walk and stand. Wheelchair bound and may even experience hallucinations. |

Generally patients are told to **draw spirals and waves** to detect Parkinson that can be evaluated from **speed of drawing and pen pressure**.

The dataset used in this study is curated by Adriano de Oliveira Andrade and Joao Paulo Folado from the ![NIATS of Federal University of Uberlândia](http://www.niats.feelt.ufu.br/en/node/81) and looks somewhat like this ![[PyImageSearch Fig.3]](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/04/29/detecting-parkinsons-disease-with-opencv-computer-vision-and-the-spiral-wave-test/):
